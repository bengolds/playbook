## Code of Conduct

### Quick Version

The MathQuill project and its supporting communication channels, including GitHub, the MathQuill Slack, and the #mathquill IRC channel, are dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, age, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate without discussion and pre-approval from a moderator. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the group at the discretion of [@laughinghan], [@stufflebear], or another moderator.

### Additional Details
Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, age, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of discussion, inappropriate contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Disclosure of another personâ€™s contact information including legal name or residence without their permission is also unacceptable behavior.
 
Participants asked to stop any harassing or inappropriate behavior are expected to comply immediately.
 
If a participant engages in harassing behavior, [@laughinghan], [@stufflebear], or another moderator may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or permanent expulsion from the channel.
 
If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact us at <coc@mathquill.com> or any moderator you feel most comfortable with as soon as possible. They will address the issue as soon as they are able to.
