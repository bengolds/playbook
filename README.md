Playbook is a tool for downloading mathematical functions from text into your brain. It does this by allowing you to explore functions in all sorts of neat ways. For a quick overview of what it can do, check out the overview video.

## Installation
Playbook is a statically served site. You should be able to get it running by just running:
```
./serve.sh
